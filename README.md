![Screenshot of the project](./screenshot.png)

A multi-page fictional restaurant website built with semantic HTML5 and custom CSS. This project simulates a real-world business layout with homepage, about, contact, and hours pages, showcasing layout techniques, inter-page navigation, and accessible form handling.

## 🔍 Overview

This project contains a 4-page HTML site styled with custom CSS, including a homepage with a dynamic taco menu, an about page with trivia, a contact form, and a store hours section.
